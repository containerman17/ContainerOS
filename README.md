# ContainerOS
## Lightweight and simple Kubernetes alternative
- Batteries included (a.k.a SSL certificates, registry and user managemet)
- Bare metal friendly 

## Personal story
My name is Ilya. I live in Florida and I am passionate about distributed systems. 

My main project is ContainerOS. It's a light-weight easy-to-use Kubernetes alternative.

I tried to implement Kubernetes in our large cluster (4800+ Cores/20+ TB RAM) but it was a big failure. Kubernetes is just too complex and has too many moving parts. Then I re-write core functionality in Kubernetes in a few weeks and it works perfectly till now. I implement ideas from this internal cluster manager into ContainerOS.

My goal with ContainerOS is to create a Kubernetes alternative, that has all the useful 

I personally adore simple projects like Linstor and Wireguard and don't like over-engineered projects like OpenVPN and CEPH. ContainerOS should be as simple as possible.
